Covered: 
UIBarButtonItem and UIActivityViewController

Challenge 
1. Try adding the image name to the list of items that are shared. The activityItems parameter is an array, so you can add strings and other things freely. Note: Facebook wonâ€™t let you share text, but most other share options will.
